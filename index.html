  <h2>Shadows</h2>
  <h3>Beating</h3>
  <p>
    Thumping, thumping --<br>
    You're here beside me.<br>
    Although I long for peace,<br>
    I do love the thumping.<br><br>

    And there's no denying<br>
    Your noiseful small findings;<br>
    For to not hear this sound<br>
    Would be much like dying.<br><br>

    Beating, beating --<br>
    After which I'm pining.<br>
    And I shall forfeit peace<br>
    To watch your heart beating.<br><br>

    Noticing you thinking<br>
    Gives to me an inkling<br>
    That something more profound<br>
    Is in those eyes, twinkling.<br><br>

    Thudding, thudding --<br>
    Sometimes you are crying.<br>
    Oh, how I loathe this peace!<br>
    Alongside the thudding.<br><br>

    It leaves me resigning,<br>
    And hoping, and sighing,<br>
    Because watching you frown<br>
    Is nothing but trying.<br><br>

    Thumping, thumping --<br>
    New eyes are now shining.<br>
    Something strange, little piece<br>
    Of someone else thumping.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beating<br><br>

    This sound redefining,<br>
    A new joy I'm finding.<br>
    With each little, soft pound,<br>
    It's hard to keep hiding.<br><br>

    Beating, beating --<br>
    Within me he's thriving.<br>
    I listen to his sound...<br>
    This new little beating.<br><br>

    The beating grows louder<br>
    Within each passing hour.<br>
    For this new love I've found,<br>
    Surely nothing could sour.<br><br>

    Then comes pause<br>
    In the thudding.<br><br>

    Remembering how I forgot<br>
    That a sound is most deafening<br>
    When suddenly it's not.<br><br>

    But you are here, thudding,<br>
    My original lot.<br>
    Your beating and thumping,<br>
    And the joy it once brought...<br><br>

    Yet now your soft beating<br>
    Brings some joy to my ears --<br>
    Joy hidden in the shadow<br>
    Of what I no longer hear.
