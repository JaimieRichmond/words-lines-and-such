      <h2>Not Mine</h2>
      <p>This is not mine<br>
      And that’s okay<br>
      The joy<br>
      The warmth<br>
      The love<br>
      The gift<br>
      It belongs to someone else<br><br>

      This hope is not mine<br>
      And that’s okay<br>
      The plan<br>
      the wish<br>
      The words<br>
      The bond<br>
      It belongs to someone else<br><br>

      This blessing is not mine<br>
      And that’s okay<br>
      The want<br>
      The question<br>
      The receipt<br>
      The relief<br>
      It belongs to someone else<br><br>

      Mine is the grief<br>
      And that’s okay<br>
      Remembering<br>
      Praying<br>
      Crying<br>
      Knowing<br>
      It belongs to me<br>
      Wishing<br>
      Wondering<br>
      Longing<br>
      Reminding<br>
      It belongs to me<br><br>

      Mine is the joy<br>
      That comes from God<br>
      Peace<br>
      Love<br>
      Grace<br>
      Comfort<br>
      It is enough for me</p>

    <section id="poem2">
      <h2>Dream</h2>
      <p>There’s, upon relinquishing mind’s duty,<br>
      Time — enough even to make stay<br>
      Things we care for somewhat less: the beauty<br>
      Of a child, with his innocence maintained.<br><br>

      However, upon waking from this lie,<br>
      The time we had now suddenly is gone,<br>
      And just the subtle blinking of an eye<br>
      Becomes an effort which takes far too long.<br><br>

      Awake, there is far less than time enough<br>
      For what is necessary — and I fear,<br>
      While contemplating such an unjust loss,<br>
      The hour melts away into a year.<br><br>

      Dreams such as these — difficult to resist,<br>
      Where one day takes a lifetime to complete.<br>
      For, when I wake, my life is but a mist;<br>
      A moment from now, I am obsolete.</p>

      <h2>The Outbreak</h2>
      <p>She waits,<br>
      watching for them.<br>
      But they do not come.<br><br>

      Where are they?<br>
      They always arrive —<br>
      but today, they do not.<br>
      And tomorrow, they do not.<br><br>

      What would you do,<br>
      if you were her?<br>
      It would be easy to leave.<br>
      But she doesn’t.<br>
      She stands,<br>
      and waits.<br>
      And she prepares a path forward.<br><br>

      For she knows,<br>
      someday,<br>
      they will arrive…<br>
      And we will all continue forward,<br>
      and her wait will have been worthwhile.<br><br>

      So she waits<br>
      Moments<br>
      Days<br>
      Years even<br>
      And keeps her faith<br>
      In this system<br>
      That at first glance<br>
      Looks so flawed.<br>
      She stands her ground.<br><br>

      And things go on<br>
      Eventually<br>
      Alien faces appear<br>
      But they do not return<br>
      But they must soon<br>
      And so she waits<br><br>

      Faces melt into normalcy<br>
      Gradually<br>
      And everything returns to normalcy<br>
      Gradually<br>
      But not really<br><br>

      For some things<br>
      Cannot be taken back<br>
      But still I wait<br>
      And I fight<br>
      For what I, what she, once had</p>
